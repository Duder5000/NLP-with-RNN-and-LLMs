# RNNs and Large Language Models (LLMs) Tutorial

Welcome to the second NLP tutorial for this week! This repository contains a series of notebooks designed to help you learn about Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and prompt engineering for Large Language Models (LLMs), essential technologies in the field of natural language processing (NLP).

## Tutorial Overview

### Text Generation with RNNs

In this notebook, you'll learn how to generate text using RNNs. We'll be using the TensorFlow framework to explore text generation, focusing on a dataset of Shakespeare's writings as a case study. This will not only introduce you to the mechanics of RNNs but also show you how to preprocess text data for these types of models.

#### Key Takeaways:
- Understand the basics of RNNs and how they can be used for text generation.
- Learn how to preprocess text data to train an RNN.
- Explore how to customize the model to work with different datasets. You'll be guided on how the Shakespeare dataset is structured, providing you with the knowledge to add your own dataset in a similar format.

### Prompt Engineering for Chatbots

Delve into prompt engineering with practical examples for creating chatbots. The links provided will serve as valuable resources for working with existing language models:
